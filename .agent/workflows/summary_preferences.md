# Ariel's Summary Preferences

## Key Requirements
- **COMPLETE COVERAGE**: Never miss any information - list EVERYTHING that was done
- **CLEAN FORMATTING**: Use tables, diff blocks, diagrams (mermaid), and visual hierarchy
- **PRESENTABLE**: Summaries should be "sexy and cool" - ready to show colleagues
- **NO SHORTCUTS**: Don't abbreviate or skip small fixes - they matter too

## Format Template
When Ariel asks for a summary, include:

1. **Header with date** - Make it clear what session this covers
2. **Systems/Features Added** - Each major system with:
   - Brief explanation of what it does
   - Flow diagram if applicable
   - Feature table with details
3. **Balance Changes** - Show before/after with diff blocks or tables
4. **Bug Fixes** - Even small ones like warning fixes
5. **Files Modified** - Complete list with summary of changes
6. **Closing statement** - Something memorable/quotable

## Example Elements to Use
- `mermaid` flowcharts for system flows
- `diff` blocks for before/after comparisons
- Tables for configuration options and stats
- `> [!TIP]` alerts for design insights
- Emojis for visual scanning (🔥⚡🎮🏹💀)

## Remember
> Ariel is **very picky** about summarization. Don't miss anything.
> Every change matters - from major features to one-line warning fixes.
